# React static list of posts

By using [posts.js](todos.js), [users.js](users.js), and [comments.js](comments.js) as modules to your React application, create and display a list of posts with the following data on each:

1) the title of the post;
2) the text (body) of the post;
3) the name, email, and address of the author of the post;
4) sublist of the post comments, including the name and email of the author of each comment as well as the comment itself.

Create and use five components: `PostList`, `Post`, `User`, `CommentList`, and `Comment`. You can use the `User` component from both `Post` (with address) and `Comment` (without providing any address).

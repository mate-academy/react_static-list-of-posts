# React Static List of Posts

> [React + Typescript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript)

This task is similar to [Static List of TODOs](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_static-list-of-todos#react-static-list-of-todos), but you should do everything yourself:

- don't change classes in the given markup (tests use them);
- create all required types in `./src/types/`;
- prepare `posts` by adding a `user` and `comments` to each `post` (each comment has a `postId`);
- split the `App` into components based on given CSS blocks;
  - styles from `App.scss` should be moved to separate files, as well. E.g.: `PostList.scss`;
- `List` components should take an array of corresponding objects and render one `Info` component per object;
- `Info` components should take one object and render its data.

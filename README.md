# React Static List of Posts (JS)

This task is similar to [Static List of TODOs](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_static-list-of-todos-js#react-static-list-of-todos), but you should do everything yourself:

- don't change classes in the given markup (tests use them);
- prepare `posts` by adding a `user` and `comments` to each `post` (each comment has a `postId`);
- split the `App` into components based on given CSS blocks;
  - styles from `App.scss` should be moved to separate files, as well. E.g.: `PostList.scss`;
- `List` components should take an array of corresponding objects and render one `Info` component per object;
- `Info` components should take one object and render its data.

## Instructions

- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).
- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.
- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://<your_account>.github.io/react_static-list-of-posts-js/) and add it to the PR description.
